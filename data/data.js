            This time, he's on a particularly thorny case, as he's responsible for protecting the president

            theater to the seedy nether regions of the city, where the criminal classes ply their questionable trades. 
            Towering above them all is the figure of Solomon, a construction magnate well on his way to rebuilding 
            the five boroughs, come hell or high water.`,
